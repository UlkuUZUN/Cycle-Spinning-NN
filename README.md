## Cycle-Spinning methodology

    - Exploits the shift variance of the underlying method.

    - Has been successfully used in image de-noising, enhancement, and super-resolution problems. 

    - Works by applying predefined spatial translations to the input image to obtain several different estimates of the output.

    - Gets the final output using the results of aligning and merging these different solutions.
