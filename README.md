Cycle-Spinning (CS) method usage in deep learning

#Cycle-Spinning methodology

Exploits the shift variance of the underlying method.

Has been successfully used in image de-noising, enhancement, and super-resolution problems. 

Works by applying predefined spatial translations to the input image to obtain several different estimates of the output.

Gets the final output using the results of aligning and merging these different solutions.
